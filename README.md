# Cell segmentation and detection

In this project, I investigated image segmentation and object detection using the data from the [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC039). The dataset contains images of cells acquired using fluorescence microscopy, along with annotations of individual cells.
